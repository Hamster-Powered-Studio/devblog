Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Our current blog is using **Static Generation** for most of the posts since we don't have the need for dynamic real-time data _yet_,
but we did have the need for generating a solid layout on given text post data.  

The initial plan was to use `markdown` syntax to write posts with ease, and then use another js library(`remark`) with **Static Generation** to turn that into
html from the given posts storage. However, The first problem I encountered was that `markdown` has somewhat limited support for certain situations
when trying to write in new layouts, and that the default styling for certain html tags often used from the translated markdown was disabled by `Tailwind Preflight`,
which was being used for better styling outside from the posts page.

As a new solution we currently have decided to go with `mdx`, which is a way of using both `markdown` and `jsx` syntax together.
This solves the problem for custom styling/designs, and opens up more flexible options for content in the post.
Although it is a bit more complicated to use, it can still act as a superset of markdown for the most part and just be used as markdown if you want to.

Our current rendering procedure goes like this.
- Posts are written in mdx format, and can use various jsx components provided in the frontend source.
- Upon build time, Next.js uses **Static Generation** to generate the post html content by parsing the mdx files with `next-mdx-remote`, a js library for parsing mdx files.
- Posts can then be accessed via listing from the main/posts page, and each post is given a unique id to access them separately.
